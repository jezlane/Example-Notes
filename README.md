## 14. Best Practices for Implementation
- **Onboarding**: Use a guided wizard with templates to minimize setup time. Offer training sessions for business unit managers.
- **Tracking**: Provide real-time dashboards with exportable reports to empower data-driven decisions.
- **Best Practices**: Curate a dynamic library with data-driven recommendations (e.g., “Campaigns offering >$10 rewards see 20% higher conversions”).
- **Promotion**: Integrate with email and social media (e.g., shareable links on X) to boost customer participation.
- **Scalability**: Design for modularity to support additional business units or reward types in future phases.

---

## 15. Customization and Next Steps
- **Customization**: If you have details about the corporation (e.g., number of business units, specific CRMs, or reward preferences), I can refine the PRD further. For example, I can add specific reward structures or integration details.
- **Visualization**: I can create a mockup of the dashboard or setup wizard in a canvas panel if you confirm. Alternatively, I can suggest how to format this in tools like Confluence or Notion.
- **Research**: I can search X or the web for industry benchmarks on referral programs (e.g., conversion rates, best reward types) to enhance the best practice library. Would you like me to proceed?
- **RACI Expansion**: I can expand the RACI matrix to include more tasks or roles (e.g., Marketing, QA) if needed.

Please let me know if you’d like to tailor this PRD further, integrate additional elements, or proceed with any of the suggested next steps!
